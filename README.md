Hi,
I'm not a JS programmer but I also hate to do activities that can be automated.

This is a small AppScript code I wrote for a real necessity at work: we had a Google Form being filled for important events and absolute no remider for the upcoming ones.
This app will remind you on the day before (D-1) and precisely on the day of the event (D0).

Feel free to use this code, just remember to set up for your own Google Sheet on CONFIG. Then, you can paste it on Google AppScript enviroment and run once so the trigger will be set. 
You may erase that part when it's already created or updated.
